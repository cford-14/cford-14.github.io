           <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
       </div> 
       <div class="description">
           <p>Below are two ideas for the CodeAcademy Premium final project. I would appreciate any advice you have on selecting one of these or devising another option. I want the project to be challenging but not impossible.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="idea" id="idea1">
           <h2>Hangman</h2>
           <div class="picwrapper">
            <img src="images/IMG_6480.jpg">
          </div>
           <p>I wrote this program in Python to help my daughter with her spelling homework. It takes a list of spelling words and an allows the user to play Hangman with each word. The words appear in random order and only appear one time each.</p>
           <p>My hangman program currently only runs in the terminal. It would need the following functionality:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>User-friendly interface</li>
               <li>Mechanism for inputting new spelling word lists</li>
               <li>Graphic display of a hangman that changed with inccoret answers</li>
               <li>Graphic display of blanks for the active word</li>
               <li>Possibly a way to collect and display number of wins</li>
           </ul>

       </div>

       <div class="idea" id="idea2">
           <h2>Shopping List</h2>
           <div class="picwrapper">
            <img src="images/IMG_6481.jpg"> 
           </div>
           <p>This application would allow users to build several shared shopping lists so that any family member could pick up groceries or household supplies. Each list item could:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Contain a user-added photo so that the shopper could view all of the details of each item. This is particularly useful when shopping for favorite brands and toiletries</li>
               <li>Items could appear on multiple lists. Sometimes an item can be purchased at the drug store or the grocery store. </li>
               <li>Items could be checked off and deleted. An item that appears on more than one list will be deleted from all lists simultaneously.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>This app could also email or text shopping lists at set times. It could also be adapted for Christmas and birthday wishlists.</p>

           <h2 id="introtitle">My Background</h2>
           <p>I have a BS in biological engineering and a MS in chemical engineering. I<span>&#39;</span>ve moved around quite a bit with my spouse<span>&#39;</span>s job. In the past 15 years, I<span>&#39;</span>ve lived in Atlanta, GA, Lawrence, KS, Mobile, AL (twice), and Duesseldorf, Germany. (Yes, I do speak some German.) In spite of moving approximately every 3 years, I<span>&#39;</span>ve had some very cool jobs including contract researcher and chemical engineering adjunct faculty.</p>
           <p>I<span>&#39;</span>m excited to shift my career to coding, particularly because of the challenging work load, high demand and potential flexibility.</p>
